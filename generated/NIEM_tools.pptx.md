# assumptions

      - who is creating IEPDs?
         - What skill set is required?
      - funding
         - level of effort
         - minimum ROM
            - LOE
               - 1 developer full time
      - timeline
         - 5 years
         - 3 phase

# Model "building blocks"

      - IEPD zip to XML Schema document set
      - XML Schema set to model
      - model to XML Schema document set
         - stabilize order of things in schemas
      - model to JSON Schema
         - JSON Schema has to generate & accommodate a specific JSON-LD context
            - so you could build in aliases
      - Zip + artifacts to Zip
      - spreadsheet to model
      - formats
         - Zip file
         - XML Schema document set
         - JSON Schema + JSON-LD context
         - OpenAPI
         - Spreadsheet
         - UML XMI
         - Clicky diagrams
         - Documentation
            - â€¦ Word doc

# Registry/Repository

      - Public
      - MilOps/DOD restricted
      - NTAC perspective
         - would like to turn FHIR elements into NIEM definitions
         - openAPI vs. JSON Schema
            - Jim thinks openAPI is our best target
            - likely that json schema won't get much use
            - service description part of an openapi is outside the "schema" part
   - roadmap
   - NIEM Tools Requirements
      - Assumptions
         - Timeline
            - 1-year first phase
            - 5 year roadmap
         - Level of effort
            - 1 developer full time
            - Management support & oversight
